# Prework Study Guide
## Description
Provide a cheat sheet of information learned during the prework to anyone who visits the website. This was done so that I could get some basic practice with HTML, CSS, JS, and Git. With this website I can now quickly look back at important tips I learend during the prework so that the information can be quickly found without having to google or search the prework modules. The GitHub practice was the only thing "new" to me. While I have worked with git before I have always used programs that do the management of Push/Pull/Commit/Checkout for me. The practice helped me better understand each step and how to do it manually.
